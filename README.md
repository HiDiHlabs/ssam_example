SSAM Example Jupyter Notebooks
==============================

This repository contains SSAM examples of three mouse brain tissue samples:
 - Primary somatosensory cortex (SSp) imaged by osmFISH
 - Hypothalamus preoptic region (POA) imaged by MERFISH
 - Primary visual cortex (VISp) imaged by multiplexed smFISH
 
And the diagnostic plots could be found in the following three directories: `diagplots_osmFISH`, `diagplots_MERFISH`, and `diagplots_multiplexed_smFISH`.

Supplemental Data
=================

The supplemental data used in the notebooks can be automatically downloaded using the script `download_data.sh`.
